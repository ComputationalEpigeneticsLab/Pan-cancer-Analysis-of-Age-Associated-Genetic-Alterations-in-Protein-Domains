## Summary
Cancer incidence and mortality differ among patients of different ages, but the functional consequences of the genetic alterations remain largely unknown. We systematically characterized genetic alterations within protein domains in relation to ages and showed that mutation effects on domains varied across age stratifies. We further identified potential age-associated driver genes with hotspots across 33 cancers. The candidate drivers involve numerous cancer-related genes participated in various oncogenic pathways, and play central roles in human protein-protein interaction networks. We found the widespread age biases in protein domain and identified the associations between hotspots and ages. Age-stratified protein-protein interaction networks perturbed by hotspots were constructed to illustrate the functions of mutations enriched in domains. We reported that young adult patients with hotspots are associated with premature senescence. In summary, we provided a catalog of age-associated hotspots and their perturbed networks, which may lead to precision diagnostics and treatments for cancer.
